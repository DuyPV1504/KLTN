      title: "Understand the difference between False and Not Given",
      description: "False statements directly contradict information in the passage. Not Given means there's insufficient information to determine if the statement is true or false. If the text doesn't mention the topic at all or doesn't provide enough detail, mark it as Not Given.",
      example: "Passage: 'The Great Barrier Reef, located off the coast of Queensland, Australia, is the world's largest coral reef system.' Statement: 'The Great Barrier Reef is in New Zealand.' This is False, as the text clearly states it's in Australia."
    },
    {
      title: "Read the statement carefully before finding evidence",
      description: "Analyze exactly what the statement claims before looking for evidence in the text. Pay attention to qualifiers like 'all', 'most', 'some', 'never', or 'always' which can change the meaning significantly.",
      example: "Statement: 'All scientists agree that climate change is accelerating.' If the text mentions 'most scientists' but not 'all scientists', this statement would be False, not True."
    },
    {
      title: "Watch out for paraphrasing and synonyms",
      description: "The statements rarely use identical wording to the passage. Look for synonyms, paraphrases, and different ways of expressing the same idea. Develop your vocabulary to recognize different ways of saying the same thing.",
      example: "Passage: 'The findings were inconclusive.' Statement: 'The research did not reach a definite conclusion.' These express the same idea using different words."
    },
    {
      title: "Be cautious with partial matches",
      description: "If only part of the statement matches the text, but other parts don't align or aren't mentioned, the statement may be False or Not Given. The entire statement must be supported by the text to be marked as True.",
      example: "Passage: 'The program was successful in urban areas.' Statement: 'The program was successful everywhere.' This would be False because the text limits success to urban areas only."
    },
    {
      title: "Don't use background knowledge",
      description: "Base your answers solely on the information given in the passage, not on your prior knowledge of the subject. Even if you know something to be true in real life, if it's not supported by the text, it's Not Given.",
      example: "If the passage discusses Albert Einstein but doesn't mention his Nobel Prize, a statement about him winning the Nobel Prize would be Not Given, even though this is a well-known fact."
    },
    {
      title: "Identify qualifying language",
      description: "Be alert to qualifying words in both the passage and statements (might, could, sometimes, often, generally, etc.). These can change the certainty of a claim and affect whether it's True, False, or Not Given.",
      example: "Passage: 'Coffee consumption might increase alertness.' Statement: 'Coffee definitely increases alertness.' This would be False because the passage expresses possibility, not certainty."
    }

    {
      title: "Focus on the writer's claims and opinions",
      description: "Yes/No/Not Given questions focus specifically on the writer's views, claims, or opinionsâ€”not just factual information. Look for language that indicates the writer's perspective or stance on a topic.",
      example: "Passage: 'I believe the government's approach is flawed.' Statement: 'The writer thinks the government's approach has problems.' This would be Yes, as it reflects the writer's stated opinion."
    },
    {
      title: "Identify opinion signals in the text",
      description: "Look for phrases that signal opinions: 'I believe', 'in my view', 'it seems that', 'evidently', 'clearly', 'without doubt', 'it is reasonable to assume', etc. These help identify what the writer truly believes.",
      example: "Passage: 'In my view, renewable energy represents the future of sustainable development.' This clearly signals the writer's opinion about renewable energy."
    },
    {
      title: "Distinguish between facts and opinions",
      description: "Yes/No/Not Given questions specifically test the writer's opinions, not factual statements. The writer may present facts without endorsing them or expressing an opinion about them.",
      example: "Passage: 'Studies show coral reefs are declining. This trend is alarming and requires immediate action.' The first sentence states a fact; the second expresses the writer's opinion."
    },
    {
      title: "Consider strength of claim in the question",
      description: "Pay attention to how strongly a view is expressed in both the passage and the question. If the passage shows mild support but the question states strong endorsement, they may not match.",
      example: "Passage: 'Electric cars might help reduce emissions somewhat.' Statement: 'The writer strongly advocates for electric cars as the solution to emissions.' This would be No, as the writer's support is qualified and tentative."
    },
    {
      title: "Look for reported opinions vs. writer's opinions",
      description: "The writer may report other people's opinions without agreeing with them. Ensure you're identifying the writer's own views, not just views they're describing.",
      example: "Passage: 'Many scientists believe AI poses existential risks, though this seems exaggerated to me.' Statement: 'The writer thinks AI is an existential threat.' This would be No, as the writer actually disagrees with this view."
    },
    {
      title: "Be careful with partial opinions",
      description: "The writer might agree with part of a statement but not all of it. If the question statement combines elements the writer agrees and disagrees with, the answer may be No.",
      example: "Passage: 'While genetic modification offers benefits for crop yield, its environmental impacts are concerning.' Statement: 'The writer believes genetic modification is beneficial without drawbacks.' This would be No."
