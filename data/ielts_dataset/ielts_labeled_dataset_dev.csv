After catching many fish he headed home.,Dennis took at least a couple days off work for fishing.,NOT GIVEN,"The text only says he decided to take a small vacation from work to go fishing.

"The Peanuts Section<br>My license expired a few days ago, so I had to go to the DMV. I waited in line for what seemed like an eternity. When I told the woman I needed a license renewed, she gave me a look. Then she clicked her tongue and said the weight needed to be updated. Thanks for the boost of confidence, DMV lady.",The line at the DMV was long,NOT GIVEN,"The context only says that they felt like they waited for an eternity. The line may have been long, but it may also be the case that they were stood behind one person who had a very complicated query and therefore took a long time and the line was actually small. Or it might be the case that the line was actually short, but because of the bleak settings it just felt like an eternity. The system could likely not make the difference between line length and wait time. "

Some might find it important while others do not.  The system was likely confused by the relativity of the word."

Five hundred feet above the ocean, she felt the wind. She was very happy and spread her arms very wide.",Lucy is very smart for believing that she could feel the wind while being inside of a plane. ,NO,"My statement is definitely incorrect because no one in their mind who thinks that taking a plane would enable them to feel the wind somehow, and someone who does would not be considered as ""very smart"". I think the system got it wrong because it thinks that intelligence cannot be determined based on a person's belief to feel the wind while being inside of a plane. "
Taylor Got a job.<br>Taylor just turned 16 and needed a job. He applied at all the burger joints in town with no luck. He then tried to go a placement agency. Once he turned in his application he was called back by a company.

"Farmer's Market<br>Benton was spending his morning at the farmer's market. He browsed through fruits, veggies, and local craft. Benton enjoys supporting local business. He filled bags with fruit and vegetables. Benton considers this a fruitful trip.",Nothing Benton took home from the farmer's market is capable of rotting.,NO,"Benton was said to fill bags with fruits and vegetables, which can rot.  The implication was that he took these bags with him.  So the statement that nothing he took home can rot is false.  The system likely does not understand that produce can rot."

She fell in love with him after hearing him play the guitar., Tim loves to create music with his strumming.

"That's right. That's the important hurdle, and we'd like to jump that first, but the other ones, Justice, you're right, in 1831 and in 1909 Congress extended terms in a way that is inconsistent with the strongest form of the test that we have advanced. Those extensions, however, were never challenged in any court and certainly not considered by this Court.",In 1909 Congress made  a bad decision to extend terms.,NOT GIVEN,I have no idea why congress extended terms- it could have been bad or could not. 
"But they see a compassionate, strong, great first lady in Laura Bush. I can't tell you how lucky I am.

""So I said all right. Bopped over there. There was only four of us there. And not only did she interest me, I guess you would say it was love at first sight.",Laura Bush was interested in him.,NOT GIVEN,it's neither correct nor incorrect because it doesn't say if she was or was not  interested at that time. I think the system read interested and assumed she was because he was.
I have seen no indication that these Liberal members who sit on the justice committee and others who well over a year ago unanimously sent to the justice committee a supply day motion by the Reform Party that called for action are serious in any way about addressing the very serious crime of impaired driving.,Liberal members don't take crime seriously.,NOT GIVEN,It is unclear if Liberal members take crime seriously. The system was confused by the context.
"But you -- under your intermediate scrutiny test we would not be hypothesizing what might have been in Congress's mind. Your First Amendment test is a stringent one.

If you take that position, I don't see how you make the retroactive-prospective line work.",The retroactive-prospective line will not work.,NOT GIVEN," The writer claims, ""If you take that position, I don't see how you make the retroactive-prospective line work."" But that doesn't mean it can't work or won't work. The model took the writer's opinion as fact."
"Everything is a gift from the Almighty. And as I measure the words of the Bible -- and we all do; different people measure different things -- the Koran, the Torah, or, you know, Native Americans who gave me a blessing the other day had their own special sense of connectedness to a higher being.

Therefore, the statement is neither definitely correct nor definitely incorrect."
"This story goes back a number of years to when a company from Nova Scotia, related by the way to the leader of the NDP, the L.E.

"
"I ask today whether the parliamentary secretary, on behalf of the minister, will confirm that this commitment would not only address the issues I have listed but would also ensure that equivalent safety facilities to those of other airports with the same capacity such as Ottawa and Winnipeg are available for Halifax International Airport.",Ottawa has a sunny beach.,NOT GIVEN,"From the context, we do not know whether or not Ottawa has a sunny beach, therefore the statement is neither definitely correct nor definitely incorrect."
"I understand that that's not what the defendants want in this case, but I don't think it's called for. And, as a matter of fact, I think if I did that and I ordered that and if -- I assume that the reporters would not testify and I would predict, if it went to the Third Circuit on that basis, I would be reversed. I don't think that that's a fair area of inquiry to get into.",the reporters would be happy to help,NOT GIVEN,it says the reporters would not testify but it never said they would not be happy to help and therefore it is neither correct or incorrect

"Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to move a motion to refer the matter of the minister's actions to the committee, if you find that there is a prima facie case, and there is no mandate from this House and no one has the right to represent that they may act for members of this House without specific authority from this House.",I am not happy to move a motion but there is no specific authority from the house.,NOT GIVEN,I introduced an emotional viewpoint that wasn't mentioned in the context but may have existed and the system may have found this nuance difficult to pick up on.
"And thirdly, we need an earned-legalization program for people who have been here for a long time, stayed out of trouble, got a job, paid their taxes, and their kids are American. We got to start moving them toward full citizenship, out of the shadows.

I think i tricked the system with the correct facts surrounding the unknown statement.
"Yes. I remember comments about our country being founded on Christianity and not needing to teach the faiths of other people. And I remember talking to my husband about that in the car ride home, as well, because we're both teachers and I was -- when I hear things like that, I immediately think of my students, and I was thinking about the diverse group of students that I have in my classroom, who all have different religious viewpoints, and how difficult that would be to tell one student that, you know, we can't express your belief, but we can express that person's belief in the classroom.",The speaker is fictional. ,NOT GIVEN,There is no way to know if the speaker is fictional or real. It could be either. 
"Hon. members will know that this official opposition attaches great importance to ensuring that parliament clearly states its intent in any bill that we consider or that we adopt, because if we do not, and the government is often sloppy in this area, we simply hand jurisdiction by default over to the courts, and that has been done far too many times.",Parliament should be replaced with an unelected upper house.,NOT GIVEN,"From the context, we do not know whether or not Parliament should be replaced with an unelected upper house, therefore the statement is neither definitely correct nor definitely incorrect."
"When an agreement of this nature was being negotiated, the governments of the day, both governments-because I hold the Government of British Columbia equally responsible-should have understood from the very beginning that if they wanted it accepted by the people of British Columbia they had to include the people of British Columbia in the negotiations so that there would be an acceptance level there.",The people of British Columbia will never accept the agreement,NOT GIVEN,They may or may not. I think the system had difficulty because I used an absolute (never)
"For example, by suggesting that the Minister of Labour uses parliamentary immunity to take an unfair action against a person, he is implying that if he spoke outside the House of Commons the Minister of Labour would be subject to some kind of civil suit, so he is imputing motives to the Minister of Labour.",The Minister of Labor is suggesting that they all don't not go out for pizza later.,NOT GIVEN,"The minister says nothing about pizza, but I guess the AI is confused."
"We are going to simply have them testify for the purpose of authenticating the contents of that article, nothing more, nothing less, because I really believe that to do more than that is to create, I think, a precedent which would have reporters called -- Mr. Benn, I think, fears that even this would do that. I don't share that fear. But to go any further than that would mean that a reporter's veracity could be questioned each and every time something like this comes up. I strain mightily not to have to do that. That's what I'm talking about. Now, I don't know if that clarifies it.",they can refuse to testify,NOT GIVEN,because of the wording

And the world benefitted tremendously from the courage that they showed in those post-war years.",World War III will take place in 2025.,NOT GIVEN,"it's neither correct/incorrect because we have no idea if another World War will take place at all, let alone knowing what year specifically. It's difficult because the text mentions WWII, so this confused the system I guess."

"Yes, yes. But it's not a statement about his heart. I don't claim to know his heart. I think he's a good person. I make no allegations about that.

If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5. 15, you're going to come here if you're worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families. And that's what's happening.","The word ""Mexico"" has more than 3 vowels",FALSE,It has exactly three vowels.

That's not good enough.","The speaker is complaining that the president has not personally inspected all of the containers coming into America, even though that's an option available to him.",NO,"The speaker obviously does not think that the president should be personally inspecting the containers coming into American ports, and it is clearly not possible, and thus not an available option.

The system presumably doesn't really know what lords and ladies are, so the context makes it's the couple's given names."
"I interpret the order and the amended order to mean that Your Honor, in a sense, has addressed them as fact witnesses. I don't think you actually come out and use the word ""fact witnesses,"" but as one reads the order, that's the implication. And you initially had indicated that you did not feel that the reporter's privilege stood in this kind of a case.","I don't think you actually come out and use the word ""fat witnesses,"" but as one reads the order, that's the implication.",FALSE,"It's definitely incorrect because the text says ""fact witnesses"", not ""fat witnesses"".

"In describing these features of the statutory review scheme in some detail, I want to emphasize that one of the important purposes of the scheme is to ensure that the people of Nunavut are not treated as second class citizens when it comes to the rights accorded to them by their court system.",The narrator wants to emphasize that one of the important purposes of the scheme is to ensure that the people of Nunavut are treated as second class citizens.,FALSE,"It says ""not treated"", not ""treated"", therefore definitely incorrect. I guess it's difficult because I changed the text and said ""the narrator', which probably confused the system."
For three days we joined the anniversary trail ride commemorating the 1874 march west of the original North West Mounted Police contingent; a great adventure which originally took 275 officers and men from Fort Dufferin south of Winnipeg all through the southern part of Saskatchewan and southern Alberta to Fort Whoop-Up 125 years before.,275 men from Fort Dufferin took 125 years to travel to Winnipeg,FALSE,"It took 3 days, not 125 years"

No more than 25% could have. The system possibly doesn't translate three-quarters to 75%"
"What I'm saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs.",This passage is about education,NO,Education is not mentioned specifically

One being Russia, where we had IMF loans that ended up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didn't help the nation.",The text mentions at least two countries.,FALSE,"It's definitely incorrect because only one country, Russia, is mentioned. It's difficult because the word nation is also used, so perhaps the system thought this was a separate country."
"Subsequently, the reporters were, if memory serves, approximately eight days ago, subpoenaed to testify by the plaintiffs in the case-in-chief. Yet another motion to quash or for alternative relief was filed by the reporters through Mr. Benn's office.","The reporters were subpoenaed to testify less than a week ago, according to this person's memory.",FALSE,"According to this person's memory, they were subpoenaed approximately 8 days ago, which is not less than a week ago. It's difficult because the text mentions days, whereas the statement mentions weeks, so this might have confused the system."
"What I have done is what every member of parliament has an obligation to do and that is to make sure that the programs that apply to the constituents under the job creation program apply to the people who voted for the member for Saint-Maurice just as the programs apply to the members for Prince George-Peace River, Kootenay-Columbia, Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Dauphin-Swan River, Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Cariboo-Chilcotin, and so on.",What we have done is what every member of parliament has an obligation to do and that is to make sure that the programs ,NO,"The narrator says it is what they have done, not ""we"".

",FALSE,it was not long ago it should have been not too long ago but the rest was verbatim so the AI recognized it as correct
"Justice, we are not making an empirical claim at all. Nothing in our Copyright Clause claim hangs upon the empirical assertion about impeding progress.

"I agree, and this Court has -- just talking about the judgment of the Congress the 105th Congress in 1998. This is the way the argument that somehow implicitly the initial 1790 copyright statute was saying to people, you get a copyright if you exchange whatever existing rights you have. That simply does not make any sense. There is no language, and it's a relatively late-discovered argument, because it sees its full --",The 105th Congress was responsible for the 1790 copyright statute,FALSE,The 105th Congress was active in 1998. I think the system got it wrong because I stitched two correct concepts together.
"The port authority may establish a certain fashion of operation based on the bylaws that are in place now in the neighbouring municipality or jurisdiction and then all of a sudden, if that jurisdiction were to change its bylaws, it could cause the port authority to have to make substantial and profound changes in the way it operates.",It would be completely illegal for the port authority to change any of its bylaws that would alter their operations.,NO,I fooled the system by the wording I used.
"Tonight the topic will be domestic affairs, but the format will be the same as that first debate.

Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests.",War in the Middle East does not impact other nations.,NO,"The speaker is talking about the interests of the United States, but when I posed the questions I stated ""other nations"", leaving the country ambiguous. The United states is not part of the Middle East and would be considered ""other nations"" outside of the Middle East, making the statement false, but creating difficulty for the computer"
"All right. Now, previously, on September 12th, the Court entered an order which went to the motion for reconsideration. That related specifically to -- filed by the reporters. That went specifically to our August 2nd order which, in effect, said that the reporters would have to testify at certain depositions.",September only has eleven days.,FALSE,"If something was entered on September 12th, we know from the context that September has more than eleven days, so the statement that September only has eleven days is definitely incorrect."
